# Class 01

- Basic intro/overview of material and syllabus
- Good introduction to the terminology (slide 17)
- I like the disucssion of the "dark arts" - it shouldn't be as taboo as it is.
- Here's a link to a Super Mario Brothers arbitrary code injection video:

- Interesting approach to learning the Linux command line: 
  http://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/ I tried to get started, but the 
  password doesn't seem to work (`bandit0`). I may come back to this later.
- A couple of simple examples/introductions to C and buffer overflows on slides 
  36-43

```bash
# using clang rather than gcc...
$ clang helloworld.c -o helloworld
$ ./helloworld

$ clang basic.c -o basic
$ ./basic

# improperly terminated string (10-10)
$ clang name.c -o name
$ ./name
What is your name?
ALEX 1234 ABCD
Hello ALEX 12344q
$ ABCD
ABCD: command not found

# intended buffer overflow:
$ clang name2.c -o name2
$ ./name
```
If you enter a long name, it should fail with a segmentation fault.
intersingly, on my system, it didn't fail too quickly... i had to put in *way* 
too many characters before I got a seg fault.

> Update: If you look at name3.c, you'll see that I've created an int prior to 
> and after the char array. If the user provides a short name, all works as it

> large number of characters, it will segfault.
