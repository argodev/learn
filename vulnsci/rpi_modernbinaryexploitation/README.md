# Modern Binary Exploitation

This section of the repo contains my notes and artifacts from walking through 
the Modern Binary Exploitation materials assembled by RPISEC. Please note, 
almost none of this (except the commentary) is mine... I am assembling it here 
as a resource for me, as I'm studying/reviewing. The originals are available 
here: https://security.cs.rpi.edu/courses/binexp-spring2015/ and 
https://github.com/RPISEC/MBE.
