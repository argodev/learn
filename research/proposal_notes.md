# Dissertation Proposal: Data-Driven Assesment of Security-Significant Properties of Control Systems

## Sub-Topics

1. What are security-significant properties?
1. Justification for a data-driven approach
1. Current work/State of the Art?
1. Modeling of traffic (what is the level of consistency, can it be spoofed, how well would anomaly detection work, etc.)
1. Modeling of reporting patterns
1. Modeling of control activities
1. Stability of traffic (response times, heartbeat consistencies, etc.)

Describe White Box, Gray Box, Black Box testing (which will we be)?

What research questions will we be targeting?

What publications will we be targeting?

For what purpose are we assessing vulnerabilities?

Is "Assessment" or "Detection" the right word???

1. Future Work

## TODO

- Obtain/Design solid 1 GB capable network tap
- Develop thorough knowlege of DNP3/IP and Modbus/IP
- Develop/obtain packet capture/dissection for both
- Build custom "packet beats" or similar for pulling packet data into ES or similar for analysis
- get Kevin Kerr's approval to do Scans
- identify which labs/test enviornments exist (and we can utlilize)
  - should have PLCs as well as other SCADA-communicating type devices

## Things to do before next Friday

- Write paragraph or two providing overview
- write ~4 page paper describing effort
- assemble slide deck

## Describe currently funded efforts

- DOE VTO: Security Assesment of High-Speed Wireless Charging Platforms - 400K over 3 years
- ORNL LDRD: Developing Red Team Capabilities for Challenging ML-Based Defenses for Cyber-Physical Systems - 1.4M over 2 years

## Pending Efforts

- ORNL Facilities: Red Team Assesment of SCADA/CPS enviornments of 5 facilities
- DOE HQ Assesment of widely deployed IOT platform
