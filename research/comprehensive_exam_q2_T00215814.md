# Question

What impact do Real Time Operating Systems have on the vulnerabilities of cyber-physical systems.  In other words, what characteristics do RTOSs have that make them more or less vulnerable (than general purpose operating systems), and what are some schemes attempted to mitigate these vulnerabilities.

# Answer

I need to specifically reference the Formby paper [-@Formby:2017:CSP:3107080.3084456]
