% Use this file to add packages that should be loaded *after* hyperref.
% See [1-3] for a list of packages that have weird interactions with
% hyperref, and should be loaded either before or after it. See [4-5] for
% a list of packages that should be loaded in a particular order, but
% don't necessarily involve hyperref.
%
% Packages that have no particular incompatibility with others can be
% loaded in either file.
