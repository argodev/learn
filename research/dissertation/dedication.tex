To my Mom, who once bought me a framed journal article\footnote{H. A. Friedman, L. M. Toth, M. M. Osborne, ``The Photochemistry of Neptunium in Aqueous Perchloric Acid Solutions,'' \textit{Journal of Inorganic Nuclear Chemistry}, 1979, vol 41, pp. 1339-1345.} she had found at a garage sale.  She said ``It had a lot of equations'' and she thought I might like it.  I'm sure she bought it as a joke, but it was her way of saying ``I'm proud of you.''  I was in elementary school when she started pursuing her undergraduate degree in education.  In watching her struggles, persistence, and eventual triumphs, she instilled in me a desire to learn, a drive to pursue greater things, and enough stubbornness to never give up.  Even though I lost her many years ago, I still have that journal article hanging in my office.
