%%% LaTeX 2e (mostly) version of TTU thesis and dissertation format
%%% by Mike Renfro (renfro at tntech.edu) et al
%%%
%%% Basic instructions for document and formatting options are
%%% included inline throughout the .tex files -- read them thoroughly,
%%% and avoid changing anything other than what is specifically listed
%%% as editable.

%%% On the \documentclass line below, one thing you might need to
%%% change would be the font size. 10pt, 11pt, and 12pt are all
%%% accepted by the Graduate School, but your advisor and committee
%%% may be more restrictive. The default of 12pt should be fine unless
%%% you have a very large committee and a long thesis or dissertation title,
%%% which would overflow the approval sheet. You may also want to add the
%%% draft option, which will reformat your thesis to take up fewer sheets
%%% during the early editing process. Finally, you may want to add the
%%% copyrighted option, which will add a copyright page to the front matter.
\documentclass[11pt,oneside]{ttuthesis}

%%% For all notes below, let JOBNAME equal the base filename of this
%%% main .tex file for your thesis/dissertation (that is, this file you're
%%% reading right now). The macro \jobname has already been set to this value,
%%% and is used in several places below. There is no need to change this unless
%%% you decide to totally rearrange how various content and settings are stored.
%%%
%%% Go ahead and save this file under a new name (thesis-your-last-name.tex or
%%% thesis-your-ttu-username.tex, for example). That way, if you happen to
%%% update to a new version of the thesis files, your changes won't be
%%% overwritten. Also, make a new subdirectory in this directory named
%%% similarly (for example, thesis-your-last-name-content or
%%% thesis-your-ttu-username-content) to hold your chapters, figures, and other
%%% related items.

%%% Notes on adding other packages to your thesis:
%
% 1. The memoir class that ttuthesis.cls is based from already
%    emulates many packages' features. There is no need to load any of the
%    following packages at all---simply use their commands as if you'd already
%    loaded them:
%
%    appendix, array, booktabs, ccaption, chngcntr, crop, dcolumn, delarray,
%    enumerate, epigraph, framed, ifmtarg, ifpdf, index, makeidx, moreverb,
%    needspace, newfile, nextpage, pagenote, patchcmd, parskip, setspace,
%    shortvrb, showidx, tabularx, titleref, tocbibind, tocloft, verbatim,
%    verse.
%
% 2. The memoir class also provides functions equivalent to those in the
%    following packages, although it does not prevent you from loading them
%    via \usepackage:
%
%    fancyhdr, geometry, sidecap, subfigure, titlesec.
%
% 3. ttuthesis.cls automatically loads the following packages. There is
%    no need to re-load them in your own files:
%
%    hypcap, hyperref, ifthen, indentfirst, listings, memhfixc, nomencl,
%    refcount, rotating, ted.
%
% 4. For any remaining packages you need to load, some may need to be
%    loaded before hyperref, and some may need to be loaded after hyperref.
%    Add your entries to JOBNAME-packages-loaded-before-hyperref.sty and
%    JOBNAME-packages-loaded-after-hyperref.sty as appropriate.

%%% Your thesis or dissertation title. Insert line breaks manually
%%% with the \\ characters so that when printed, the title has an
%%% inverted pyramid format. If your title contains Greek letters,
%%% superscripts, subscripts, or other typography that can't be
%%% rendered as a PDF string, use the command
%%% \title{\texorpdfstring{TeX title}{PDF title}} instead.
\title{Data-Driven Assessment of Network-Based Anomaly Detection Systems Protecting Cyber-Physical Systems}

%%% Your name, as registered at the university.
\author{Robert E. Gillen}

%%% This example and style file was designed to render into a PDF file
%%% rather than DVI or Postscript, and for all cross-references (to
%%% specific chapters, pages, equations, references, etc.) to be
%%% hyperlinks in that PDF. The hyperref package handles the
%%% hyperlinks, and also the basic metadata for the PDF, such as the
%%% author, keywords, etc.
%%%
%%% ttuthesis.cls automatically fills out the fields for pdfauthor and
%%% pdftitle. The pdfkeywords and pdfsubject fields are optional, but
%%% may be useful in the future if we do an electronic archive of
%%% theses and dissertations and want to make it easier to search. If
%%% you don't fill out accurate subject and keywords fields, please
%%% remove or comment the following hypersetup command entirely.
%%%
\hypersetup{
  pdfsubject={Format and style rules for theses and dissertations at Tennessee Technological University},
  pdfkeywords={thesis, dissertation, style guide}
}

%%%
%%% Other information relevant to the front matter of your thesis.
%%%

%%% Your abstract.
\abstract{%
  My thesis has an abstract. Here it is.
}

%%% Is this document and thesis or a dissertation?
\doctype{Dissertation}

%%% Your planned degree
\degree{Doctorate of Philosophy}

%%% Your major. Engineering PhD students would just put Engineering
%%% here, not a specific department's name.
\department{Engineering}

%%% The month and year of your graduation.
\graduationmonth{December}
\graduationyear{2019}

%%% The text of your dedication page, if you have one.
\dedication{%
  \begin{center}
    This thesis is dedicated to my parents \\
    who have given me invaluable educational opportunities.     
  \end{center}
}

%%% The text of your acknowledgments page.
\acknowledgments{%
  Appreciation is extended to my advisor and other committee members.
}
%%%
%%% Information about your committee.
%%%
%%% Note: you may have to switch to a smaller font if your
%%% thesis/dissertation title is very long and your committee is very large.
%%% Using a 10pt font, a title seven lines long only allows for six people
%%% on the committee (including chairs and cochairs). A title two lines long
%%% allows for up to nine people on the committee (including chairs and
%%% cochairs).

%%% First, who is your committee chair?
\committeechair{Steven Scott}

%%% Second, does your committee have a single chair, or two cochairs?
%%% If you have two cochairs, use one name in \committeechair, and the
%%% second name in \committeecochair. If you have no cochair, leave the
%%% \committeecochair command commented out.
%\committeecochair{Cochair's Name}

%%% Third, what are the names of your committee members?
\committeemembers{Adam Anderson, William Eberle, Mike Rogers, Sheikh Ghafoor}

\begin{document}

%%%
%%% Typesetting your document's front matter. Most of this is automated.
%%%
%%% Abstract page, title page: mandatory, automatically added to all
%%% theses and dissertations. Use the \abstract, \title, \author, \doctype,
%%% \degree, \department, \graduationmonth, and \graduationyear commands
%%% above to edit the page content. The page format and location is fixed,
%%% and cannot be edited.
%%%
%%% Copyright page: optional, automatically added to all theses and
%%% dissertations with copyrighted in the \documentclass options above. The
%%% page format and location is fixed, and cannot be edited.
%%%
%%% Approval page: mandatory, automatically added to all theses and
%%% dissertations. Placed immediately after the copyright page (if present)
%%% or the title page (if no copyright page is present).  The page format
%%% and location is fixed, and cannot be edited.
%%%
%%% Dedication page: optional, automatically added to all theses and
%%% dissertations with a \dedication command. Placed immediately after the
%%% approval page. The \dedication command defines the content of the 
%%% dedication page. The page format and location is fixed, and cannot be
%%% edited.
%%%
%%% Acknowledgments page: optional, automatically added to all theses and
%%% dissertations with a \acknowledgments command. Placed immediately after the
%%% dedication page (if present) or the approval page (if no dedication page
%%% is present). The \acknowledgments command defines the content of the 
%%% acknowledgments page. The page format and location is fixed, and cannot be
%%% edited.

%%% The table of contents and lists of figures, tables, etc. Except
%%% for commenting out the lists of tables, figures, or other elements
%%% missing from your document, you shouldn't need to change any of
%%% the table of contents commands.
\begin{Spacing}{1}
\tableofcontents*  % Leave the * after this command to keep the table of
                   % contents from appearing in the table of contents
\listoftables      % Tables
\listoffigures     % Figures
\lstlistoflistings % Program Listings, from the listings package
%%% If you want to rename your list of symbols, edit the
%%% \renewcommand{\nomname} command accordingly.
\renewcommand{\nomname}{LIST OF SYMBOLS}
\printnomenclature % Symbols
\end{Spacing}

%%% Leave the \mainmatter and command alone. This resets the page numbering
%%% and styles from what's appropriate for the front matter to what's
%%% appropriate for the body of your thesis/dissertation.
\mainmatter

%%% Edit the \include commands below to match the base filenames of
%%% your chapter files. Do *not* add a .tex extension to the filename
%%% -- chapter1.tex is included with a \include{chapter1} command.
\include{\jobname-content/introduction}
%\include{\jobname-content/analytical}
%\include{\jobname-content/experimental}
%\include{\jobname-content/results}
%\include{\jobname-content/conclusions}

%%% Bibliography settings
\renewcommand{\bibname}{References}
\include{\jobname-content/bibliography}

%%%
%%% Appendices settings
%%%

%%% Does your thesis have one appendix, or multiple appendices?
%%% Uncomment or comment each of the next two lines accordingly.
\renewcommand{\appendixtocname}{Appendix} % I have only one appendix
%\renewcommand{\appendixtocname}{Appendices} % I have multiple appendices

%%% If you have any appendices on your thesis, leave the \appendix and
%%% command alone. It resets the ToC style to label your appendices by
%%% letter rather than number, and typesets the required separation page
%%% between the Appendices and the main body text. If you have no
%%% appendices, comment the \appendix command.
\appendix

%%% Edit the \include commands below to match the relative path and base
%%% filenames of your appendix files. Do *not* add a .tex extension to the
%%% filename -- appendix-a.tex is included with a \include{appendix-a}
%%% command. Obviously, if your thesis has no appendices, then comment them
%%% all.
%\include{\jobname-content/code-listings}

%%% Edit the \vita command below to match the relative path and base
%%% filename of your vita. Do *not* add a .tex extension -- vita.tex is
%%% included with a \vita{vita} command.
\vita{\jobname-content/vita}
