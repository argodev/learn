Technological University's thesis and dissertation format. When
complete, it should provide:

* A current copy of university thesis and dissertation guidelines

* Additional examples not given in the guidelines showing best
  practices for various elements common to theses and dissertations

* Consistent use of modern LaTeX tools, including the memoir class,
  PDF graphics, hyperref, longtable, amsmath, and BibTeX.
