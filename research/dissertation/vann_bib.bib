  abstract  = {Parkinson's disease is known to cause mild to profound communication impairments depending on the stage of progression of the disease. There is a growing interest in home-based assessment tools for measuring severity of Parkinson's disease and speech is an appealing source of evidence. This paper reports tasks to elicit a versatile sample of voice production, algorithms to extract useful information from speech and models to predict the severity of the disease. Apart from standard features from time domain (e.g., energy, speaking rate), spectral domain (e.g., pitch, spectral entropy) and cepstral domain (e.g, mel-frequency warped cepstral coefficients), we also estimate harmonic-to-noise ratio, shimmer and jitter using our recently developed algorithms. In a preliminary study, we evaluate the proposed paradigm on data collected through 2 clinics from 82 subjects in 116 assessment sessions. Our results show that the information extracted from speech, elicited through 3 tasks, can predict the severity of the disease to within a mean absolute error of 5.7 with respect to the clinical assessment using the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale; the range of target motor sub-scale is 0 to 108. Our analysis shows that elicitation of speech through less constrained task provides useful information not captured in widely employed phonation task. While still preliminary, our results demonstrate that the proposed computational approach has promising real-world applications such as in home-based assessment or in telemonitoring of Parkinson's disease.},

  abstract = {This paper compares digital spectrum estimation techniques which can be used to extract speed information from rotor slot and eccentricity harmonics contained in the stator current. In previous work, speed-related current harmonics have been shown to improve the performance of existing back-EMF-based sensorless schemes, since these harmonics are parameter independent and exist at virtually any nonzero speed. Digital filtering, however, requires a minimum data sampling time in order to achieve the desired resolution. The contribution of this paper is to determine the optimal method for accurately extracting the speed-related harmonics in the least amount of time. Several digital signal processing algorithms are investigated, including the fast Fourier transform and other traditional methods, as well as parametric techniques which can provide improved spectrum estimation for short data records. Each approach is evaluated on the criteria of accuracy, robustness, and computation time given a short data record},

  abstract = {Deep learning allows computational models that are composed of multiple processing layers to learn representations of data with multiple levels of abstraction. These methods have dramatically improved the state-of-the-art in speech recognition, visual object recognition, object detection and many other domains such as drug discovery and genomics. Deep learning discovers intricate structure in large data sets by using the backpropagation algorithm to indicate how a machine should change its internal parameters that are used to compute the representation in each layer from the representation in the previous layer. Deep convolutional nets have brought about breakthroughs in processing images, video, speech and audio, whereas recurrent nets have shone light on sequential data such as text and speech.},

The algorithm is based upon a simplified version of a general technique for fundamental frequency extraction using digital inverse filtering. It is demonstrated that the simplified inverse filter tracking algorithm (hereafter referred to as the SIFT algorithm) encompasses the desirable properties of both autocorrelation and cepstral pitch analysis techniques. In addition, the SIFT algorithm is composed of only a relatively small number of elementary arithmetic operations. In machine language, SIFT should run in several times real time while with special-purpose hardware it could easily be realized in real time.},

  abstract  = {Multilabel classification is a rapidly developing field of machine learning. Despite its short life, various methods for solving the task of multilabel classification have been proposed. In this paper we focus on a subset of these methods that adopt a lazy learning approach and are based on the traditional k-nearest neighbor (kNN) algorithm. Two are our main contributions. Firstly, we implement BRkNN, an adaptation of the kNN algorithm for multilabel classification that is conceptually equivalent to using the popular Binary Relevance problem transformation method in conjunction with the kNN algorithm, but much faster. We also identify two useful extensions of BRkNN that improve its overall predictive performance. Secondly, we compare this method against two other lazy multilabel classification methods, in order to determine the overall best performer. Experiments on different real-world multilabel datasets, using a variety of evaluation metrics, expose the advantages and limitations of each method with respect to specific dataset characteristics.},
