# Dissertation Proposal: Data-Driven Assesment of Security-Significant Properties of Control Systems

## Sub-Topics

1. What are security-significant properties?
1. Justification for a data-driven approach
1. Current work/State of the Art?
1. Modeling of traffic (what is the level of consistency, can it be spoofed, how well would anomaly detection work, etc.)
1. Modeling of reporting patterns
1. Modeling of control activities
1. Stability of traffic (response times, heartbeat consistencies, etc.)

1. Future Work

## TODO

- Obtain/Design solid 1 GB capable network tap
- Develop thorough knowlege of DPN3/IP and Modbus/IP
- Develop/obtain packet capture/dissection for both
- Build custom "packet beats" or similar for pulling packet data into ES or similar for analysis
