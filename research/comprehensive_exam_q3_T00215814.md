# Question

How may evolving computer architectures affect and be affected by future cyber-physical systems?  In general consider from low level architecture such as processor, cores, gpu, etc.  to higher levels such as cloud, edge, fog computing, etc.  and embedded systems like those going into vehicles and sensors.  Please limit your response to at most 3-pages as I realize this alone could make a dissertation level discussion.
