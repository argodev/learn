# Chapter 1: Introduction


## Why Data Mining?
- Explosive growth of data
- "Drowning in data, but starving for knowledge"
- Data analysis and decision support
- Tex mining
- stream mining
- Cross-market analysis
- Customer profiling/requirement analysis
- Financial planning and asset evaluation
- Competition
- Fraud Detection/Unusual Patterns

## What is Data Mining?
- Knowlege Discovery from Data
- Interesting: non-trivial, implicit, previously-unkown, potentially useful
- Also called:
  - Knowledge Discovery, knowledge extraction, data dredging, information harvesting, business intelligence
- it is *not* just simple search or query processing

## Knowledge Discovery Process
1. Data source
2. Data Cleaning
3. Data Warehouse/Integration
4. Selection of Task Relevant Data
5. Data Mining
6. Pattern Evaluation
7. Knowledge

## Alternative Process View
1. Input Data
2. Data Pre-Processing
   1. Data Integration
   2. Normalization
   3. Feature Selection
   4. Dimension Reduction
3. Data Mining
   1. Pattern discovery
   2. Association and Correlation
   3. Classification
   4. Clustering
   5. Outlier Analysis
4. Post-Processing
   1. Pattern evaluation
   2. Pattern selection
   3. Pattern interpretation
   4. Pattern visualization
5. Pattern/Information/Knowlege


## Technology Overviews
- Time and Ordering (Sequential Pattern, Trend, and Evolution Analysis)
- Structure and Network Analysis
  - graph mining, information network analysis

> NOTE: Not all discovered patterns are interesting

"Data mining may generate thousands of patterns: Not all of them are intersting" (most are not)

"A pattering is _interesting_ if it is _easily understood_ by humans, _valid_ on new or test data with some degree of _certainty_, _potentially useful_, _novel_, or _validates some hypothesis_ that a user seeks to confirm"

Finding *all* interesting patterns... an issue of completeness... often an unbounded problem

True data mining requires a confluence of diciplines:
- Maching Learning
- Pattern Recognition
- Statistics
- Visualization
- High-Performance Computing
- Database Technology
- Algorithm Develpoment
- Application Development/design

## Major Issues
- Mining Methodology
- User Interaction: is the system responsive enough? How do you incorporate background knowlege? How do you visualize the results?
- Efficiency/Scalabilty
- Diversity of data types: combine complex data types into single system?
- Societal impacts (privacy, surveillance)
