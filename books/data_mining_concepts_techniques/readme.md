# Data Mining: Concepts and Techniques
_Third Edition_

This book was part of my coursework and was not one that I selected. Initially, I was a bit disappointed with the class and felt that it would not add value to my overall knowlegebase -- like many things, however, further reflection helped my perspective. As an aspiring data scientist, it is books such as this that, while not amazing in new technologies, nor necessarily cutting edge in any way, form the foundation of a methodology that will serve me well. It is the formalization (or structure) of the approach that is most beneficial. Yes, these concepts are things I generally know and practice. However, codifying them in a clear fashion is important to consistently applying them on future efforts.

It is important to acknowlege that I claim very little ownership over the content in this repository. This is essentially a running-list of notes made for my personal benefit while working thorugh the text and may (and does) contain direct copies/quotes from the text. Often, these quotes are not specifically acknowleged as to do so in a personal notebook might add more ceremonial noise than necessary.
