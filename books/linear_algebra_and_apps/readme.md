# Linear Algebra and Its Applications

I am _not_ a math person. In fact, I may be the furthest thing from such. My view of math is likely what other's view of computer science is... a large number of symbols and puntuation that seems to do more confounding than clarifying. That said, I consistantly find myself in a position wherein I need to understand math better than I do. Linear Algebra is foundational for Machine Learning for example. To that end, I am endeavoring to march through this material with a moderat amount of rigor and discipline so that I may gain a working knowlege of topics such as matrix multiplication, eigen values, etc.

As with most of my book walk-throughs, the following are links to the writeups/notes that I took while working through the material. The primary audience is myself (forcing myself to learn). I hope it may be helpful to others in some fashion.
