# Zero to Deep Learning

## Chapter 1: Introduction

Basic introduction
List of Math Operations we need to know:

* Sums (Big E notation)
* Partial Derivatives
* Dot Product (and possibly other linear algebra)

Development Environment
Book recommends miniconda/anaconda, but I'll lean towards the normal python stuff... specifically python 3

```bash
# using the helper
mkvirtualenv -p /usr/bin/python3 z2dl
workon z2dl

# install requirements
pip install -r reqirements.txt

# if you update any packages, be sure to update the repo
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```
