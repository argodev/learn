# Chapter 10 - OpenCL Profiling and Debugging

## Profiling Code using Events

This section provided the "built in" means of profiling generic OpenCL code. The authors describe the use of events to collect timing information and thereby derive hot spots and areas of the logic to further investigate. Not surprisingly, the out-of-the-box platform is not incredibly interesting nor feature-rich. The basics are all there, but GUI-level profiling tools aren't provided by the spec (no surprise).

## AMD CodeXL

The remainder of the chapter was a commercial for AMD's product, CodeXL. I found this both informative and also disappointing. I would have been more interested had they spend equal time on the tools provided by some of the other major OpenCL SDK providers (IBM, NVidia). I'm assuming similar tools exist from the other vendors, and as a purported neutral textbook, it seems a glaring oversight.

That said, the tools from AMD look solid and should provide an OpenCL developer clarity into the benefit of the kernels being used and/or which kernels need additional work.
