# Chapter 13 - Foreign Lands

This last chapter wraps up the text with a very short nod to the non-C/C++ support for OpenCL.

The authors mention and describe both Java and Python wrappers (via their language-specific bindings to C). They provide a python sample of the vector addition from early in the book.

Finally, they discuss and provide some examples of using Haskell with OpenCL. I'm uncertain of the overall utility of such, but I find it interesting nontheless.

The python bindings are interesting to me in the context of a project at work wherein we are doing a decent amount of compute on an embedded platform and are considering using the onboard GPU for reducing some of the total compute time.
