# Heterogeneous Computing with OpenCL 2.0
My interest in reading this book is as an extension of the work I've done in the
past with CUDA. On the surface it looks interesting as a potential platform 
independent option. Also interesting is that it looks like it might work for 
GPUs, CPUs, and FPGAs (in some cases).
