# Appendix C: Need-to-Know C Programming

This chapter is designed to help the reader get started with C if they are not yet comfortable. It starts with an explanation of compiled vs. interpreted code, typed languages, and passing by value vs. reference. This is followed by a quick survey of some of the syntax (semicolons, braces, etc.).

Data types, delcarations and assignments are covered next. The authors then briefly describe function declarations before moving into the first example to create, complile, run and debug an application.
