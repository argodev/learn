# CUDA for Engineers
_An Introduction to High-Performance Parallel Computing_

I worked through this book as part of my degree program as well as in support of my general work efforts. I selected this book as it appeared to be focused much more on the practical aspects of using CUDA than the theoretical.

It is important to acknowlege that I claim very little ownership over the content in this repository. This is essentially a running-list of notes made for my personal benefit while working thorugh the text and may (and does) contain direct copies/quotes from the text. Often, these quotes are not specifically acknowleged as to do so in a personal notebook might add more ceremonial noise than necessary.

> NOTE: My initial pass through this book was focused purely on a Linux-based system. As such, my comments/reviews/testing were targeted at that system only. My development machine was a HP G4 Zbook with an nVida P3000 graphics card running Ubuntu 17.04
