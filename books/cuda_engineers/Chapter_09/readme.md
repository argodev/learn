# Chapter 9: Exploring the CUDA Ecosystem

This chapter is a very quick read and provides some guidance as to additional resources you might be interested in if you want to continue your CUDA education. The authors start with what they call their __Primary Sources__ which includes a nyumber of web sites, online courses, and books. The material and links provided here are solid, though somewhat dated. This book was written in 2015 and it reaches back to texts that were published in 2007. Many of the resources were dated when this book was published and are now very much so. That said, many of the resources have enduring value and can aid in the understanding of complex aspects of GPU programming with CUDA.

The chapter ends with a __Further Sources__ section that points to some addition items that are interesting but not quite as broadly applicable. This section sufffers from the same aging issues that the _Primary Sources_ section had, but is still worth a look.

## Reference Sources

I thought that, in the spirit of this last chapter, there might be value in sharing some links of materials that have been helpful to me in my study of GPU programming. Like any list, this will likey fall out of date, but these were all valid/helpful as of the date the list was compiled (4/21/2018).
