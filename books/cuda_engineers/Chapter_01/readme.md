# Chapter 1: First Steps

After a quick review of the introduction, I started reading this chapter. I immediately came to the first checkpoint: __Ensure you have a working CUDA development enviornment__ and therefore stopped and jumped to the appendicies to confirm my environment was ready. I quickly worked through [Appendix A: Hardware Setup](../Appendix_A/readme.md) followed by [Appendix B: Software Setup](../Appendix_B/readme.md). I then went on to perform the work in [Appendix C: Need-to-Know C Programming](../Appendix_C/readme.md) to further verify my system's setup. I wrapped up my walk through the appendicies with [Appendix D: CUDA Practicalities: Timing, Profiling, Error Handling, and Debugging](Appendix_D/readme.md). This last section walks through a number of common tasks one needs to know how to accomplish during CUDA development and I found this clear and helpful.
