# Chapter 1: First Steps

After a quick review of the introduction, I started reading this chapter. I immediately came to the first checkpoint: __Ensure you have a working CUDA development enviornment__ and therefore stopped and jumped to the appendicies to confirm my environment was ready. I quickly worked through [Appendix A: Hardware Setup](../Appendix_A/readme.md) followed by [Appendix B: Software Setup](../Appendix_B/readme.md).
